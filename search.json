    "text": "My name is Cameron Hernandez, I am a Senior at Harvey Mudd College currently perusing a bachelors in engineering. I am is passionate about electronic hardware and circuit designs. I have expierence ranging from working with power electronincs, desigining autonomous robotics, simulating electrically small antennas, and creating a multicycle processor. Stepping away from electrical engineering, I have taken engineering courses in the chemical, mechanical, material, and systems domains."
