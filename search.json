    "text": "Reflection\nI am looking forward to this semester, the labs seem very exciting and hands on. Some skills I am hoping to learn are a better understanding of how FPGA’s are utlized in real world settings. I have used an FPGA in my most recent internship, but it was very breif and I would have liked to have pushed my understanding of how they work a little more. I am hoping to finishing all of the labs while maintaining a healthy sleep balance, however, lab 3 may have to say otherwise…"
